# Pointer

Key concept:  a pointer is nothing more than an integer containing an address of memory.  TYPES ARE NOT REQUIRED

A POINTER JUST POINTS TO A LOCATION OF MEMORY.

When a type is provided all that is being indicated is that the the memory at the address that the pointer contains is of that type.

Dereferencing a pointer - accessing the data.
